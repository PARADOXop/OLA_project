Resume bulletpoints:
Analyzed 103K+ ride bookings and identified a 41.7% cancellation rate; proposed completion-focused OKRs and matching improvements projected to reduce cancellations by 8–12%, unlocking significant incremental revenue.

Diagnosed short-distance rides (~73% cancellations) and driver unavailability as primary failure points; recommended minimum fares, driver incentives, and predictive positioning expected to improve short-ride completion by 15–20%.

Quantified ₹565M in booking value with high unrealized revenue, estimating that a 5–10% improvement in ride completion could recover ₹28–56M in additional revenue without increasing demand.
