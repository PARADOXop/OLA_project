Use cases:  1. Identifying peak demand hours and optimizing driver allocation.2
            2. 
data model

data cleaning
1. handle missing values
2. check for duplicates
3. change dtypes
4. check for outliers and distribution


data transformation:
1. cancellation reason if ride was cancelled
2. remove time from date column
3. distance category 

Exploratory data analysis

1. How does booking value vary across different vehicle types and distance categories?

2. Are certain pickup–drop location pairs associated with higher booking values and ride volumes?

3. What factors are most strongly associated with ride cancellations?

4. Is there a relationship between ride distance and cancellation probability?

5. How do vehicle turnaround time (V_TAT) and customer turnaround time (C_TAT) impact ride status?

6. Does driver rating influence customer rating and ride completion?

7. Are specific time periods associated with higher booking demand and cancellations?

8. Which vehicle types are the most operationally efficient in terms of revenue, turnaround time, and ride completion?

9. What patterns differentiate high-value repeat customers from low-value or churn-risk customers?
