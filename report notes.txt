OLA Project


Problem statement: OLA, transformed urban mobility by offering convenience and affordability to millions of users. 
                   while doing this they generate vast amounts of data related to ride booking, driver avaibility, fare calculations, customer preferences, etc.
                   however deriving actionable insights from this data remains a challenge. to enhance operational efficiency, improve customer satisfaction and
                   optimize business strategies. this project focuses on analyzing OLA's ride-sharing data


Use cases:  1. Identifying peak demand hours and optimizing driver allocation.2
            2. 
data model

data cleaning
1. handle missing values
2. check for duplicates
3. change dtypes
4. check for outliers and distribution


data transformation:
1. cancellation reason if ride was cancelled
2. remove time from date column
3. distance category 

Exploratory data analysis

1. How does booking value vary across different vehicle types and distance categories?

2. Are certain pickup–drop location pairs associated with higher booking values and ride volumes?

3. What factors are most strongly associated with ride cancellations?

4. Is there a relationship between ride distance and cancellation probability?

5. How do vehicle turnaround time (V_TAT) and customer turnaround time (C_TAT) impact ride status?

6. Does driver rating influence customer rating and ride completion?

7. Are specific time periods associated with higher booking demand and cancellations?

8. Which vehicle types are the most operationally efficient in terms of revenue, turnaround time, and ride completion?

9. What patterns differentiate high-value repeat customers from low-value or churn-risk customers?

Insights

1️⃣ Cancellation Crisis (41.7%)

Insight: Nearly 2 out of 5 bookings are incomplete, driving significant revenue leakage and poor customer experience.
Action & Impact: Set completion-rate OKRs and real-time cancellation tracking to unlock immediate revenue gains and improve customer trust.

2️⃣ Short-Distance Rides Are Broken

Insight: Short-distance rides face ~73% cancellations, far higher than medium and long trips due to poor driver incentives.
Action & Impact: Introduce minimum fares, short-trip incentives, and ride batching to reduce cancellations and improve driver acceptance.

3️⃣ Driver Availability Is the Core Issue

Insight: “Driver Not Found” is the leading cancellation reason, indicating a persistent supply-demand mismatch.
Action & Impact: Use predictive driver positioning and dynamic incentives to improve match rates and reduce customer wait times.

4️⃣ Cancellations Are Systemic

Insight: Uniform cancellation rates across vehicle types, hours, and days point to a platform-level structural problem.
Action & Impact: Redesign matching logic and apply reliability-based incentives to achieve consistent, platform-wide cancellation reduction.

5️⃣ Revenue Exists but Execution Is Inefficient

Insight: ₹565M in booking value is generated despite high cancellations, highlighting large unrealized revenue potential.
Action & Impact: Shift focus to fulfillment optimization and cancellation-loss tracking to increase realized revenue without extra marketing spend.

6️⃣ Ratings Don’t Prevent Cancellations

Insight: High driver and customer ratings do not reduce cancellations since failures occur before ride execution.
Action & Impact: Focus on pre-ride levers (availability, pricing, ETA accuracy) while using ratings only for post-ride quality control.

Conclusion:
The platform’s key challenge is operational inefficiency rather than lack of demand, with a high 41.7% cancellation rate driven by systemic supply-side and incentive issues—especially
for short-distance rides. Improving driver availability, pricing alignment, and matching logic can significantly increase ride completion and unlock revenue growth without additional 
demand acquisition.

Resume bulletpoints:
Analyzed 103K+ ride bookings and identified a 41.7% cancellation rate; proposed completion-focused OKRs and matching improvements projected to reduce cancellations by 8–12%, unlocking significant incremental revenue.

Diagnosed short-distance rides (~73% cancellations) and driver unavailability as primary failure points; recommended minimum fares, driver incentives, and predictive positioning expected to improve short-ride completion by 15–20%.

Quantified ₹565M in booking value with high unrealized revenue, estimating that a 5–10% improvement in ride completion could recover ₹28–56M in additional revenue without increasing demand.
